    <p style="text-align: center;">Regardless of their design, the purpose of speakers is to produce audio output that can be heard 
    by the listener.<br> Speakers are transducers that convert electromagnetic waves into sound waves.<br>
    The speakers receive audio input from a device such as computer or an audio receiver.

    <br> The parts of a speaker are:<br>

    -The cone and the dust cap (the parts that move air and produce sound)<br>
    -The spider and the surround (also called the suspension, these are the parts that hold the cone in place while still allowing them to move)<br>
    -The magnet and the voice coil (the parts that interact to convert electric energy into motion)<br>
    -The basket<br>
    -The pole and top plate<br>
    -And finally the frame that mounts everything together

<h3 style="text-align: center;" id="C">How do speakers work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="..\pictures\How do speakers work.png" width=40% alt="This is picture shows some speaker parts for explaining the basics how do speakers work" title="how do speakers work"></a><br>
    Speakers work by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy (motion). The mechanical energy<br>compresses air and converts the motion into sound energy or sound pressure level (SPL).
When an<br>electric current is sent through a coil of wire, it induces a magnetic field.

In speakers, a current is sent<br>through the voice coil which produces an electric field that interacts with the magnetic field of the permanent<br>magnet attached to the speaker.

Like charges repel each other and different charges attract.  As an audio signal<br>is sent through the voice coil and the musical waveform moves up and down, the voice coil is attracted and<br>repelled by the permanent magnet.

This makes the cone that the voice coil is attached to move back and forth.<br>The back and forth motion creates pressure waves in the air that we perceive as sound.

<h3 style="text-align: center;" id="D">Why do speakers have to be in a box?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sgatlas.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fluance_Ai40_LK_10-1000x667.jpg.webp">
    <img src="..\pictures\why do speakers have to be in boxes.png" width=30% alt="This picture show a speakerbox" title="why do speakers have to be in a box"></a><br>
    Without the enclosure, even the best speaker would sound thin and reedy. The main job of the speaker<br>enclosure is to prevent this type of sound cancellation. It must keep the sound radiation from the front of the cone<br>from colliding in midair with the sound radiation from the rear of the cone.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" id="E">Why do speaker boxes need air holes</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kanto-tuk-review-speaker-back.jpg">
        <img src="..\pictures\Holes.png" width=50% alt="This picture shows a speakerbox with an hole" title="why do speakerbox need to have an airhole"></a><br>
    Speakers have holes to allow the lower frequencies that often get trapped in the back to be enhanced.<br>When your speaker is working, the vibrations inside compress air in the front and back, which can become unbalanced.<br>Bass reflex systems have these holes, so the bass sounds are not lost.</p>
